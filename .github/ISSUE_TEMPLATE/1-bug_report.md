âš  Most errors triggered by libWrapper are not caused by libWrapper itself, but by a module/package. Do not open a support ticket using this form unless you are seeing an **internal** libWrapper error or are a **package developer** who needs support. We also do not provide support for packages that promote or otherwise endorse piracy. Your issue will be closed as invalid if you do not fulfill these requirements.

The easiest way to find support is to ask the community. The largest community-provided support channels are:
- [FoundryVTT Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt)'s #modules-troubleshooting channel
- [FoundryVTT Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT)
